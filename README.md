# SitePrism
_A Page Object Model DSL for Capybara_

SitePrism gives you a simple, clean and semantic DSL for describing your site using the Page Object Model pattern, for use with Capybara in automated acceptance testing. It encourages the "Page Object Model" pattern and makes it easy to do it well. One of its aims is to provide a pleasant syntax when using rspec/cucumber matchers and expectations.
