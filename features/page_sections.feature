Feature: Page Sections
	As a tester
	I want to be able to interact with element collections on a page
	In order to get and set values on the page
	
	@wip
	Scenario: Designate a section of a page
		When I navigate to the home page
		Then I can see elements in the section
		#When I navigate to another page
		#Then that section is there too!
